# Diabetes Prediction System

## Overview
The **Diabetes Prediction System** is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on medical data. This system helps in early diagnosis and preventive healthcare by analyzing key health indicators.

## Features
- **Predictive Modeling**: Uses machine learning techniques to assess diabetes risk.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and processes medical datasets for accurate predictions.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifies patterns in health indicators.
- **Model Evaluation**: Uses accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics to assess model performance.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides easy-to-read predictions and visualizations.

## Technologies Used
### Software
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
  - `numpy`: For numerical computations.
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: For data visualization.
  - `scikit-learn`: For machine learning model development.
  - `XGBoost`: For advanced gradient boosting.

### Hardware
- Standard computer with Python environment.

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**:
   - Loads diabetes-related medical data.
   - Cleans and preprocesses data for model training.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Identifies key health factors affecting diabetes risk.
   - Visualizes important correlations in the dataset.

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**:
   - Trains various machine learning models.
   - Evaluates model performance using classification metrics.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Uses the best-performing model to predict diabetes risk.
